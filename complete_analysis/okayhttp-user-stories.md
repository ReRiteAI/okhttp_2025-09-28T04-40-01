   Acceptance Criteria:
   ‚Ä¢ Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
   ‚Ä¢ Circuit breaker opens after configurable failure threshold
   ‚Ä¢ Health checks can determine when to close circuit breaker
   ‚Ä¢ Different retry policies can be applied based on error type
   ‚Ä¢ Retry and circuit breaker metrics are exposed for monitoring

üéØ Story 4: As a security engineer, I want to implement certificate pinning for enhanced security
   I need to configure OkHttp with certificate pinning to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure secure communication with critical backend services.

   Acceptance Criteria:
   ‚Ä¢ Certificate pins can be configured for specific hosts
   ‚Ä¢ Pin verification failures are properly handled and logged
   ‚Ä¢ Backup pins can be configured to prevent service disruption
   ‚Ä¢ Pin validation works with certificate rotation scenarios

üéØ Story 5: As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive metrics and observability for HTTP client performance
   I need detailed metrics from OkHttp to monitor application performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot network-related issues in production environments.

   Acceptance Criteria:
   ‚Ä¢ Request/response metrics include timing, size, and status code data
   ‚Ä¢ Connection pool metrics show utilization and performance
   ‚Ä¢ Metrics can be exported to monitoring systems (Prometheus, etc.)
   ‚Ä¢ Request/response logging can be configured for debugging
   ‚Ä¢ Performance metrics are available per host and endpoint

üéØ Story 6: As a microservices developer, I want to implement request/response interceptors for cross-cutting concerns
   I need to add authentication, logging, tracing, and other cross-cutting concerns to all HTTP requests without modifying individual service calls in my microservices architecture.

   Acceptance Criteria:
   ‚Ä¢ Application interceptors can modify requests before network calls
   ‚Ä¢ Network interceptors can inspect actual network requests/responses
   ‚Ä¢ Interceptors can be chained and executed in defined order
   ‚Ä¢ Request/response data can be modified or enriched by interceptors
   ‚Ä¢ Interceptors can handle authentication token refresh automatically

üéØ Story 7: As an API consumer, I want efficient HTTP/2 support for improved performance
   I need OkHttp to automatically use HTTP/2 when available to improve performance through request multiplexing and server push capabilities when communicating with modern APIs.

   Acceptance Criteria:
   ‚Ä¢ HTTP/2 is automatically negotiated when server supports it
   ‚Ä¢ Multiple requests to same host share a single connection
   ‚Ä¢ Server push frames are properly handled when supported
   ‚Ä¢ Connection multiplexing reduces overall latency
